      Please understand that maintainer time is limited and many image formats
      are complex, even the seemingly simple ones. We do not generally start
      from-scratch implementations. Formats are supported by including existing
      libraries with bindings such that they can be optionally enabled. Among
      our preference for such dependencies are:
      * Good test coverage
      * Purely Rust
      * Only the necessary amount of `unsafe` in the dependency tree, encapsulated in well-reviewed libraries
      * A small dependency list

      For further information, see the discussion page:
      <https://github.com/image-rs/image/discussions/2570>. You can think of it
      like a mini-RFC forum.

      The issue type for new formats is reserved for tracking concrete
      implementation and their bindings, i.e. discussing an API mismatch that
      prevents a library from having its bindings for `image` written.
